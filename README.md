# cfied-linux

cfied-linux is a repository dedicated to various Linux commands I have implemented into C as practice, optional coursework for [Systems Programming](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp24/), and overall just for fun. These programs were essential to getting the most out of C, comprehending its string, signal handling, socket capabilities, alongside implementing essential data structures.
